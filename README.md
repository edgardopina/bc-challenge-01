This project required to take existing code and refactor it to meet the minimum acceptance criteria associated to an **user story described below**. A main focus of the project is to ensure minimum Web accessibility compliance to enable people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to this website.

## User Story

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## (minimum) Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
